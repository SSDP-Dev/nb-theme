    <li>We will support 4,500 students for sensible drug policy in 50 US states and 32 countries.</li>
    <li>We will continue to develop and grow the SSDP Alumni Association program, more strongly connecting students to Alumni members through the mentorship program, keeping Alumni engaged as advocates, and developing Alumni as philanthropists. Membership will grow to more than 260 members.</li>
    <li>We will provide meaningful, region-specific resources and support to our international chapter network and seek out opportunities to empower international SSDP chapters within the SSDP network.</li>
    <li>We will pilot a program to recruit and train four Regional Fellows in global regions with high levels of SSDP activity that will enhance the capacity of our chapters to engage in meaningful policy change and coalition building.</li>
    <li>We — staff and members — will collaborate with allies from across the political spectrum and non-drug policy reform groups to spread our message of reform.</li>
    <li>We will actively engage our stakeholders through regular, meaningful, and carefully curated contact.</li>
    <li>We will seize compelling opportunities to address external audiences concerning drug policy reform and to engage in public dialogues.</li>
